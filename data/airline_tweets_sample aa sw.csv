2,.@AmericanAir can you connect me to a person without having to wait 2+ hours on hold? I still haven't been able to resolve the problem.
3,.@AmericanAir just disappointed with the Flight Booking Problems process and add’l fees to sit together on a more crowded flight. Not impressed so far :-/.
4,".@AmericanAir: the best the agent could do is put me on a flight arriving tomorrow afternoon, with a six hour layover."

20,"@AmericanAir @praywinn between understaffing, what looks like a labor slowdown, weather, incompetence, and disregard for the customer..."
21,@AmericanAir @robinreda being stuck two days in the airport is not something pretty normal. I am positive you can find a plane to Europe

57,@AmericanAir how can I get you guys to respond to my tweets and DM??? Really sad feeling to be ignored.
58,@AmericanAir how do I see your report team?
59,@AmericanAir how nice it would be if you had helpful flight attendants instead of the rude nasty ones you employ. #WhyAreYouYelling
60,@AmericanAir i appreciate your apology. Sincerely. Thank you. That's really all I ever wanted to begin with.
61,@AmericanAir I Cancelled Flightled my ticket and is taking two months ++ to refund and still waiting!
62,@AmericanAir I don't think you should help him at all based on his behavior. The voucher and cot seem like enough lol 😃
63,@AmericanAir I had a 6am flight I can get no rest because I have to wait another 2 hours to receive an automated phone call. #neveragain
64,@AmericanAir I have looked and I was told it was in Guatemala last night. No record of anywhere today. I need my clothing for work tomorrow.

68,@AmericanAir I hope you like the photo :) http://t.co/p7fSLuxEGW
69,@AmericanAir I know.  After an hour I got a live person.  It messes up our arrival and car plans at two airports and is costing us more.
70,"@AmericanAir I love the service and cheap upgrades American Provides! One of the best airlines ever! good food, good seats, amazing thanks!"
71,"@AmericanAir I need to complain to AA, but the email form field doesn't allow enough characters for my complaint. Have a real email address?"
72,"@AmericanAir i ordered it as i always do. But on a 9hour flight delayed for 4 hours, it was worse than ever before when you forgot my meal."
73,"@AmericanAir I slept in the miami airport due to mechanical issues and was given 10,000 bonus miles to try and make it right. #slapintheface"
74,"@AmericanAir I sure hope you all can fix @USAirways. Good luck, their service sucks. #nexttimeiwillflysouthwest"
75,@AmericanAir I think 2 weeks of waiting is more than enough time for you to contact me.  This is why you lose customers
76,@AmericanAir I wait 2+ hrs for CS to call me back re why  flt is cxld/protection &amp; they hang up the minute I answer on 1st ring?
77,"@AmericanAir i want to change my flight for next week, they will still charge me. Waiting for fligt status"
78,@AmericanAir I was told I had a 20minute wait time after waiting hours. And an hour has gone by. This is ridiculous
79,@AmericanAir I was worried when my bag went SAN to DCA 24 hours before me. But our reunion was an organized  breeze! http://t.co/uOARyQ98PU

86,"@AmericanAir I'm trying my hardest to not get frustrated, but I am getting no response on email or by phone. AA owes me $500. How do I claim"
87,@AmericanAir instead they yelled at him and told him to call a number that will not pick up due to call volume
88,@AmericanAir interested in possibly changing my flight to another day...need to see if there are any fees but your number is busy
89,@AmericanAir Is there a way I can get a record of all the flights I've taken with you?
90,@AmericanAir it's always nice coming home but I wish you'd fly LAX-MAD and keep me away from Iberia 😜✈️ #GoingForGreat

101,@AmericanAir no email no phone call no nothing. You've screwed with my flight and my family/Friends flights. You Cancelled Flighted reservations for
102,@AmericanAir no not yet. Waiting to be connected to an agent
103,@AmericanAir no one met flight 1081 to LAX to tell passengers where to go or what flights they were rebooked on #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines
104,@AmericanAir no private msg me and will provide details...u really need customer svc training for your staff
105,@AmericanAir No worries they called back 4 hrs Late Flightr while I was asleep and took an additional $200 fee. So by AA standards everything's gr8
106,@AmericanAir not anymore.
107,@AmericanAir not in any way that I am happy with or find acceptable.   If I could speak to a human maybe that would happen
108,@AmericanAir now we are all stuck on the plane after landing because crew unable to figure it out
109,"@AmericanAir Oh,i already have turned  itover to them, but apparently losing someones bag on their honeymoon doesn't require accountability"
110,@AmericanAir ok thank you!
111,@AmericanAir ok thank you. What if I can't get a hold of someone to get a new flight?
112,"@AmericanAir Ok. We will probably Cancelled Flight our flights then, take a refund, and get home another way. Wednesday won't work for us."
113,"@AmericanAir on plane for JFK-&gt;SFO, been sitting here for 1.5 hours waiting for push crew, how is this acceptable?"
114,@AmericanAir or at the very least an explanation on why no one told me my flight was Cancelled Flightled!
115,@AmericanAir our flight was Cancelled Flightled and rebooked to United. You didn't give them accurate ticket number now we can't check in. #annoyed
116,@AmericanAir over 70 days  no contact from a human or apology letter. @AmericanAir is #yucki. Read all about it soon http://t.co/9R9OmzQAVI
117,@AmericanAir Phone just disconnects if you stay on the line. Need to checkout of hotel in 2 hrs &amp; have no place to go. Can't keep calling.
118,@AmericanAir please do something about boarding at DCA 35X. Many delays + buses to planes on tarmac despite empty gates. Disorganized mess.
119,@AmericanAir pretty lame response to a two paged single spaced letter http://t.co/aCebo6ELPa
120,@AmericanAir really? Not even worthy of a response. This is beginning of a social media alert to the world that AA and @USAirways are useles
121,@AmericanAir right so I missed my connection / had a three hour Kay over / then you lost my bag.
122,"@AmericanAir said that AA does not provide in-flight wifi on the routes to China based on some federal laws, but United does, why is that?"
123,"@AmericanAir seems like queue times are very high, in Q waiting for an agent 4 almost  an hour.Flight got Cancelled Flightled. http://t.co/sDm2wvR3zr"
124,@AmericanAir sent

129,@AmericanAir so great AA1103 sitting for an hour first technical problems now what?
130,"@AmericanAir Telling frustrated customers ""we are super busy, please call back Late Flightr kthxbai"" and then hanging up is not the best practice."
131,@AmericanAir terror story my luggage was delayed both ways on an international flight for over 5 days total #angrycustomer
132,"@AmericanAir Thank you for the worst experience ever on an airline, from me to you, I hope your embarrassed as an airline. Pathetic"

137,@AmericanAir thanks for getting back to me. But I will find other airlines in the future.

140,@AmericanAir Thanks! Great stuff! I can only imagine how jammed everything is.
141,@AmericanAir Thanks! He is.
142,"@AmericanAir Thanks, both airlines said that it is located at AA Detroit. Also was informed that it flew with AA, which shouldn't matter."
143,@AmericanAir that doesn't really answer my question. Maybe if I provide more details you can give me clarification...
144,"@AmericanAir That's good, I'd expect that but I can't get through on the phone to make any changes. Can I change it online?"
145,"@AmericanAir That's ok...You may keep my $25 and lose my bag with no info, but you no longer have my trust. Bad way to handle this."
146,"@AmericanAir that's the one. My original arrival time was 10:14am, after all said and done I may be there by 9:19pm central. Not impressed."
147,@AmericanAir the reservation system won't even let us leave our phone #. I have no way to fix that you rebooked me on wrong day!
148,@AmericanAir The wine served in USAirways flights are watered down somehow right out of the bottles.
149,@AmericanAir they will just say dumb things to beat around the bush ! If you're flight Cancelled Flightled be prepared for no compassion from them
150,"@AmericanAir third you lost her bag &amp; after 50 mins of being on hold you told her she would ""eventually get her bag"" completely unacceptable"
151,@AmericanAir try this. DPDFPP
152,@AmericanAir um no just hanging out what’s new w you?
153,@AmericanAir was told at 7pm my bags would 1000% be at my house by 9pm. Well they're not and I continue to be lied to.

161,@AmericanAir why arent callings going thru it doesnt have me wait or anything and automated stuff is messed up
162,"@AmericanAir why do you continually play the ""according to federal regulations"" every 58 seconds. I could see if you had quicker service..."
163,@AmericanAir work on the comm skills w hate agents at PHX. Said I was confirmed on flight out of DFW &amp; got here and that was only standby.
164,@AmericanAir would have been nice if the agents were at the very least courteous since the delay was AA's fault
165,"@AmericanAir would like to talk to someone, please follow."
166,@AmericanAir yes I did but no response.
167,@AmericanAir yes....twice...for two different flights and occasions
168,@AmericanAir you all should really be ashamed. The entire business class cabin is empty and almost all of first class...
169,"@AmericanAir You are jumping the gun and Cancelled Flighting flights that could've made it before the snow. Now, more Cancelled Flightlations. It's ridiculous."
170,"@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight due to ""weather"" when others are flying out just fine.  No compensation, no resolution.  Incompetent."
171,@AmericanAir you have the worst reps at Jacksonville airport. So rude and totally not helpful at all!
172,@AmericanAir you have to run the engine to troubleshoot an issue before boarding the plane!?! How about another plane? #aa2227 #miatoiah
173,@AmericanAir you suck worst airline ever I will never be flying you again I have been stuck here for 13 hours no one is helping #fuckoff
174,@AmericanAir Your people on the phone can't see those? And to have it be over $800 difference. That's a poor process then...
175,"@AmericanAir You've misunderstood. @USAirways WOULD NOT do a same day flight change for me. The gate agent said, ""NO."""
176,"@AmericanAir
 Your response could have made all the difference. It could have made the situation better. NO TRUST...GET LOST like my bag."

181,@SouthwestAir  on hold with customer service; you may be quicker.  I rebooked trip for a lower fare.  Where did the difference in $ go?
182,@SouthwestAir - really?  All other carriers are staffed and you've got a triple looped one and no employees in sight in OKC
183,@SouthwestAir  thanks for adding passbook ability! Hopefully we can do group passbook tickets in the future somehow.

209,@SouthwestAir are passengers automatically rebooked on other flights if original is Cancelled Flighted for weather etc?
210,@SouthwestAir Bad enough that there is no seat assigned he's  seating at an exit seat and a male flight attendant removes him from there
211,@SouthwestAir because your gate attendant let someone board whose boarding pass kept reading invalid. This messed up the passenger log.
212,@SouthwestAir been on hold for 1.5 hrs. What's up?
213,"@SouthwestAir been with my GF for 2.5yrs, she's from SF &amp; I live in Tulsa. SWA always takes me there to see my love! #SouthwestLuvSweeps"

242,@SouthwestAir here we go again. Delayed in Chicago why offer the 630 flight if you never intend to fly it
243,@SouthwestAir How can you get your TSA traveler ID added to your boarding pass? Why would it not be included as TSA precheck? Flying tomorro
244,@SouthwestAir how do I get a companion pass
245,@SouthwestAir how long does it take for points from RR Shopping to post to my account? Got email saying I've earned points but don't see em
246,@SouthwestAir How? It is not possible to call SWA on the phone. You put me on hold for an hour and then cut me off.
247,"@SouthwestAir I ""heart"" Southwest but those commercials aimed to satisfy a nano-smattering of travelers to few destinations."
248,@SouthwestAir I also find it ridiculous that I've been tweeting to you since 3:50 AM EST and have still received no response. 9 hours?
249,@SouthwestAir I cannot DM you as you do not follow me.
250,"@SouthwestAir I had to travel to Savannah, GA, once again, on an airline I don't ""Luv"". When r u going to fly me to Savannah? Pleeeease!!!!"

254,@SouthwestAir I never got my flight confirmation. I've been on hold for an hour and I can't get info online. What am I to do?
255,"@SouthwestAir I thank you for the reply but too complicated to DM, really would like to talk to a cust rep. What is going on there?"
256,"@SouthwestAir I understand weather is not your fault, but as a frequent flyer I expected better customer service. I'll be trying @Delta"
257,"@SouthwestAir I understand. But it's consistent, and been consistent for years. It's known around the country."
258,"@SouthwestAir I use to #LUV swa but after an hour and counting on hold, for a flight they Cancelled Flighted on me? #noluv"

283,"@SouthwestAir res chg online/app no work, still on hold, faster for hubby to DRIVE to airport to make change @ counter #fail"
284,"@SouthwestAir right but the point was that my kids don't fly often, but I do. I bought four round trip tickets from DtW to PHX so I'm...."
